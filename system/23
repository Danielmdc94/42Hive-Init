# Explain how connect yourself as new user. (With graphic session and ssh session)

# As in exercise 'system/17' to connect with an ssh session in a different machine(like this Mac from the virtual debian machine I use the command 'ssh -p 3022 <username>@127.0.0.1'.

# The former IP references this machine's own IP. If it was a different IP this should be changed.

# The '-p 3022' is the port I configured to link with the port 22(default for ssh) of the guest machine.

# If I wanted to use this command from the same virtual debian machine I would change the port to 22; 'ssh -p 22 <username>@127.0.0.1'.

# Otherwise, from the virtual debian machine the user can be logged in (No need for ssh connection) with the command 'su - <username>'.

# You always need the password to connect or log in, except with sudo or as the root user.
